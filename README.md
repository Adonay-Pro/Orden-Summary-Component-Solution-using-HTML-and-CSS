## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I applied for first time in project the ".svg format" en HTML and  "position:relative" property in CSS. 

```html
   <img class="musicicon" src="/order-summary-component-main/images/icon-music.svg">
```

```css
.precio{
   position: relative;
    top: 5px;
    bottom: 0px;
    right: 80px;
    left: 5px;
}
```
### Continued development


I Would like to know more about using the "position:" property. but, in general get more abilities to make more projects quicker and to be a better frontend developer
